streamlit gmail and github login code

Just Built a Secure Login Page with Gmail & GitHub Authentication using Streamlit! 🔐

I recently developed a modern and interactive login page that supports authentication via Gmail and GitHub using OAuth 2.0, all within a simple and clean Streamlit web app.

🛠️ Tech Highlights:

🔒 OAuth 2.0 based secure login

📧 Gmail authentication using Google Cloud credentials

💻 GitHub login via GitHub Developer API

🌐 Responsive layout with CSS for a modern user interface

🎯 One-click login with dynamic hiding of alternate options

✨ Features:

Clean UI with icons

One-click Gmail/GitHub login

Session-controlled login state

Easy integration into any Streamlit-based application

📌 Use Case: This login module can be integrated into any internal tool, dashboard, or prototype that needs user-based access.

💡 Why Streamlit? Because it lets you turn Python scripts into beautiful, shareable web apps — fast and easily.
